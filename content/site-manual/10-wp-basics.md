## Getting Started


### WP Admin Dashboard

From the Dashboard Screen, you can quickly access your site"s content and get glimpses into other areas of your website and the WordPress community.

### WP Contextual Help Button

Wordpress displays a Help button (in the upper right corner of the CMS) at all times through every page of the CMS Dashboard. This button is helpful by providing contextual information based on what area of the CMS you are currently working in. It provides a few brief sentences describing the purpose and capabilities of the page while also providing quick links to the official Wordpress Support documentation.


### WP Admin Toolbar

The Wordpress CMS can be navigated via the main toolbar located on the left-hand side of the screen when you are logged into the CMS. Here you will find all the available content types and site options available to you (note: some user roles may have different administrative permissions). Additionally, when logged into your Wordpress website there is an (optional) toolbar that displays at the very top of the screen on the front-end of the website with shortcuts to all the common content types and site settings.


## Posts

Posts are what make your blog a blog they're individual pieces of content on your blog page. Posts are entries listed in reverse chronological order on your site. Think of them as articles or updates that you share to offer up new content to your readers. Posts are always associated with a date, which is included in the URL.

To write a post:
1. Log in to your WordPress Administration Screen (Dashboard).
2. Click the "Posts" tab.
3. Click the "Add New" sub-tab.
4. Start filling in the blanks: enter your post title in the upper field, and enter your post body content in the main post editing box below it.
5. As needed, select a category, add tags, and make other selections from the sections below the post. (Each of these sections is explained below.)
6. When you are ready, click Publish.

## Pages

A page is an area on your site where you can display content. A page can be about anything at all. Some of the most common pages on a website include Home, About, and Contact pages. You can add as many pages to your site as you would like, and you can update your pages as many times as you want. After you create a page, you can add it to your site"s navigation menu so your visitors can find it.
Pages are static and are not affected by date. Think of them as more permanent fixtures of your site, an About page, a Contact page, and a Home page are great examples of this.

What Pages Are
- Pages are for content that isn't specifically time-dependent, or which isn't "blog content".
- Pages can be organized into pages and subpages.
- Pages can use different page templates, including template files, Template Tags and other PHP code.
- More sophisticated themes may provide a wider range of adjustments or display options for individual pages.

To create a new Page, log in to your WordPress installation with sufficient admin privileges to create new pages. Select the Pages > Add New option to begin writing a new Page.

### Post & Pages - Revisions

WordPress.com autosaves your work and stores revisions for each post or page on your site. Revisions allow you to revert to an earlier version of a page or post.


### Saving and Autosave

As you write and edit your posts and pages on WordPress, the changes you make are automatically saved to your local device about every 15 seconds. In the Publish Module at the top right of the editor, you"ll see the notification move from Save Draft to Autosaving to Saved.


### Viewing Revisions

The Revisions screen shows any backup copies of your post or page. Each time you save a draft manually or select Update, a revision is saved. Revisions allow you to look back at the recent changes you"ve made and revert to an earlier version if necessary.

To restore an earlier version of a page or post:
1. Go to My Site -> Pages (or Posts)
2. Edit the page or post you want to view revisions for.
3. On the right side, under Page/ Post Settings, look for Revisions.

## Media Library

The Media Library is where you can manage your images, audio, videos, and documents all in one place. To view your Media Library, click on Media in your dashboard.

When you add images and other media to your pages and posts, they will appear in your Media as well. You can also add files directly to your Media to later use in your pages and posts. There are two methods to do this: add files from your computer and add via URL.


### Add Files From Your Computer

1. In the Media Library click Add New.
2. Select the media files you want to upload from your computer and click upload or open (the name of the button depends on which browser you"re using.)

You can select multiple media files at once by holding down the control key (on PC) or the command key (on Mac) while clicking multiple files in the upload window.

You can also drag and drop media files from your computer directly into the Media Library.

## Menus

Your menu is the list of links that are typically displayed at the top of your site. A menu makes it easy for your visitors to find their way around your site"s pages and other content. Our guides will show you how to create and manage your site"s menu.

A menu contains links to pages, blog posts, and other content so that your visitors can easily navigate around your site. This guide will show you how to add links to your menu.


### Add Menu Items

To start adding links to your menu, follow these steps:
1. Go to Appearance -> Customize -> Menus.
2. Choose the menu you wish to add to. If there is no menu here, create a menu first.
3. Ensure you have selected at least one menu location, or the menu will not be visible.
4. Click the + Add Items button.
5. Under Pages, you will see a list of your site"s published pages (private pages and draft pages will not appear in the list.) Click on any page title to add it to your menu. You may also add posts, portfolio projects, blog categories, custom links to other websites, and more.
6. If you wish to rearrange the items or make dropdown menus, click Reorder. This is explained in more detail here.
7. Click Save Changes to publish the changes to your site.

## User Profile

The Your Profile Screen is accessible from both the main navigation menu under Users and by clicking on your name link at the top of the WordPress screen. Here you can specify your name and how it will be displayed on your site, your e-mail address (for administrative purposes), other personal information, and personal options.

The only pieces of information WordPress requires you to include in your Profile are your e-mail address and a nickname. It should be noted that WordPress requires your email address only for your blog"s administration purposes. The email address is never sent to any other site (not even to the people at WordPress headquarters), and it is never displayed on your site (unless you put it there manually). Only the other registered users of your blog have access to the e-mail address you provide. Also, remember that each user"s email address must be unique.


### Personal Options

- Visual Editor - Checking this box Disables the visual editor when writing, and uses the plain HTML editor.
- Toolbar - Check the box to display the Toolbar when you are viewing your site.
- Admin Color Scheme - Check this radio button next to the color scheme desired for the Administration Screens. The left two colors are menu background colors and the right two are roll-over colors.


### Account Management

- Generate Password - You can click this button to generate a new password for the account. This will show you a new field with the generated password. If you choose to change this password, a checkbox will appear to confirm that you want to use a weak password. You can check this box to confirm that you want to use your own password instead of a secure one.
- Strength Indicator This indicates if the password you entered is Very Weak, Weak, Medium, or Strong (displayed in green). The stronger the password the more secure your login. Hint: The password should be at least seven characters long. To make it stronger, use upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols.
- Log Out Everywhere Else - You can click this button to log out of other devices, such as your phone or a public computer.
