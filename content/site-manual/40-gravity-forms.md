# Gravity Forms

Gravity Forms is a WordPress plugin that allows site owners, admins and developers to create simple and complex forms to collect information on their WordPress site, and then decide what to do with that information. Gravity Forms can be used for contact forms, WordPress post creation, calculators, employment applications and more.

### Notifications

When a user submits a form, it can be quite helpful for the site administrator to receive a notification that a form has been successfully submitted. This ensures that you do not have to constantly check your Entries table to see if anything has been submitted. In this article, we will show you how to configure a basic notification for one of your forms.

### Confirmation

A form needs to always process one confirmation, and therefore the Default Confirmation cannot be deleted, removed, or inactivated.

To display a custom confirmation message, you will need to edit the Default Confirmation or create a new confirmation with conditional logic enabled appropriately. The Default Confirmation will be used if the logic fails on all other confirmations.
